2020年9月24日，“华为全联接大会”在上海举行，浦发银行行长潘卫东出席大会，并与华为公司常务董事汪涛联合发布了《物的银行》白皮书。这是业内首次提出面向“智能物”的全新金融服务模式和设计体系，将开启“物的银行”服务新纪元。

潘卫东在会上指出，我们正从“万物互联”进入“万智互联”时代，联接力也是生产力，通过智能网络联接云、边缘、终端，释放数字生产力，再基于“智能物”联接场景，构建起“以人为中心”的智能空间，提供全景式服务。在智能空间中，金融服务将发挥粘结剂的作用，依托智能、高效、协同的生态平台，实现多方共赢，服务实体经济发展。 

“物的银行”的主要特征是将直接服务对象由“人”延伸到“智能物”，构建以场景为核心的业务模式，以及基于客观数据信用体系的风险管理模式。 

> On September 24, 2020, the "Huawei full connection conference" was held in Shanghai. Pan Weidong, President of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, attended the conference and jointly released the white paper "Bank of things" with Wang Tao, executive director of Huawei. This is the first time in the industry to propose a new financial service mode and design system for "smart things", which will open a new era of "Bank of things" service.

> Pan Weidong pointed out at the meeting that we are entering the era of "Internet of all things" from "Internet of all things". The link is also a productivity. We connect the cloud, edge and terminal through the intelligent network, release the digital productivity, and then build a "people-centered" intelligent space based on the connection scenario of "intelligent things" to provide panoramic services. In the smart space, financial services will play the role of a binder, relying on an intelligent, efficient and collaborative ecological platform to achieve win-win results and serve the development of the real economy.

> The main feature of "Bank of things" is to extend the direct service object from "people" to "intelligent things", build a business model with scenario as the core, and a risk management model based on objective data credit system.
